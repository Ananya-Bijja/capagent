# EXAMPLE: Captioning an image with max length 10 words.
# USER IMAGE stored in example_image_data as ImageData.
# USER REQUEST #: Please captioning this image within 10 words.
# RESULT #:
THOUGHT 0: First, I need to use visual question answering tool to get the caption of the image. Then I need to check the number of words in the caption. If the number of words is more than 10, I need to use the shorten_caption tool to shorten the caption. Otherwise, there is no need to shorten the caption.
ACTION 0:
```python
caption = single_image_visual_question_answering(query="Please describe this image briefly.", image_data=example_image_data)
print("Caption:", caption)
count = count_words(sentence=caption)
print("The number of words in the caption is:", count)
```
OBSERVATION: Execution success. The output is as follows:
Caption: In the image, there are two black, rectangular mesh wastebaskets centrally placed, side by side. The wastebaskets are identical, both featuring a sleek and modern design.
The number of words in the caption is: 32
THOUGHT 1: Since the number of words in the caption is more than 10, I need to use the shorten_caption tool to shorten the caption. And then I need to check the number of words in the shortened caption.
ACTION 1:
```python
result = shorten_caption(caption=caption, max_len=10)
print(result)
count = count_words(result)
print("The number of words in the shortened caption is:", count)
```
OBSERVATION: Execution success. The output is as follows:
A photo of two black mesh wastebaskets.
The number of words in the shortened caption is: 8
THOUGHT 3: The number of words in the shortened caption is less than 10. Now I can answer the user's request.
ACTION 3: No action needed.
ANSWER: A photo of two black mesh wastebaskets. TERMINATE
