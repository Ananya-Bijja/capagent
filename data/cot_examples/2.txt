# EXAMPLE: Captioning an image with more than 50 words with keyword constraint.
# USER IMAGE stored in example_image_data as ImageData.
# USER REQUEST #: Please captioning this image with more than 50 words and include the words "tabby cat" and "orange".
# RESULT #:
THOUGHT 0: First, I need to use visual question answering tool to get the caption of the image. 
ACTION 0:
```python
caption = visual_question_answering(query="Please describe this image.", image_data=example_image_data)
```
OBSERVATION: Execution success. The output is as follows:
Caption: The image shows a close-up of an orange tabby cat.
THOUGHT 1: The caption already includes the words "tabby cat" and "orange". I need to check if the caption is longer than 50 words.
ACTION 1:
```python
count_words(caption=caption)
```
OBSERVATION: Execution success. The output is as follows:
The number of words in the caption is: 11
THOUGHT 2: The caption is shorter than 50 words. I need to use the extend_caption tool to ask and answer questions to detail the caption.
ACTION 2:
```python
extend_caption(image_data=example_image_data, caption=caption, iteration=3)
```
OBSERVATION: Execution success. The output is as follows:
Caption: The image shows a close-up of an orange tabby cat with well-groomed and fluffy fur, particularly noticeable on the neck and the visible part of the back, which has a smooth and healthy sheen. The cat's expression seems alert and possibly playful, with a wide-open mouth and visible teeth, indicating a vocalization that could be a playful meow or a yawn.
The number of words in the shortened caption is: 68
THOUGHT 3: The caption is longer than 50 words. Now I can answer the user's request.
ACTION 3: No action needed.
ANSWER: The image shows a close-up of an orange tabby cat with well-groomed and fluffy fur, particularly noticeable on the neck and the visible part of the back, which has a smooth and healthy sheen. The cat's expression seems alert and possibly playful, with a wide-open mouth and visible teeth, indicating a vocalization that could be a playful meow or a yawn. TERMINATE
