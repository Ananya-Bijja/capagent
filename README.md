# CapAgent

In this section, we introduce the CapAgent, an agent system with a variety of tools specifically designed to control the image captioning process. As shown in the following figure, like a general agent, CapAgentâ€™s workflow includes three main steps: planning, tool usage, and observation. When the user inputs an image and a caption query, the CapAgent will generate a series of thoughts and corresponding actions to tackle the user request.
