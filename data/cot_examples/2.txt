# EXAMPLE: Captioning an image with more than 50 words.
# USER IMAGE stored in example_image_data as ImageData.
# USER REQUEST #: Please captioning this image with more than 50 words.
# RESULT #:
THOUGHT 0: First, I need to use visual question answering tool to get the caption of the image. Then I need to check the number of words in the caption. 
ACTION 0:
```python
caption = single_image_visual_question_answering(query="Please describe this image.", image_data=example_image_data)
print("Caption:", caption)
count = count_words(caption=caption)
print("The number of words in the caption is:", count)
```
OBSERVATION: Execution success. The output is as follows:
Caption: The image shows a close-up of an orange tabby cat.
The number of words in the caption is: 11
THOUGHT 1: Since the length of the caption is less than 50 words, I need to use the detail_caption tool to ask and answer questions to detail the caption.
ACTION 1:
```python
result = detail_caption(image_data=example_image_data, caption=caption, iteration=3)
```
OBSERVATION: Execution success. The output is as follows:
Caption: The image shows a close-up of an orange tabby cat with well-groomed and fluffy fur, particularly noticeable on the neck and the visible part of the back, which has a smooth and healthy sheen. The cat's expression seems alert and possibly playful, with a wide-open mouth and visible teeth, indicating a vocalization that could be a playful meow or a yawn.
The number of words in the shortened caption is: 68
THOUGHT 3: The caption is longer than 50 words. Now I can answer the user's request.
ACTION 3: No action needed.
ANSWER: The image shows a close-up of an orange tabby cat with well-groomed and fluffy fur, particularly noticeable on the neck and the visible part of the back, which has a smooth and healthy sheen. The cat's expression seems alert and possibly playful, with a wide-open mouth and visible teeth, indicating a vocalization that could be a playful meow or a yawn. TERMINATE
